# Devil May Chainsaw - Credits

## Title Screen

- The silhouette from DMChainsaw's title comes from the [DOOM Comic](https://www.doomworld.com/10years/doomcomic/).
- The "Devil May" voice clip comes from [Devil May Cry 1's title screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY22aCkCnE).
- The "Chainsaw" voice clip comes from [Project Brutality](https://www.moddb.com/mods/project-brutality),
though I'm not sure where *they* got that voice clip from or if it was recorded
just for PB.
- The music is "Devils Never Cry" from Devil May Cry 3.

## Shotgun

- Taken directly from DOOM II: Hell on Earth's super shotgun graphics. I know
the DOOM II IWAD will include the graphics and sound anyway, but I want
DMChainsaw to be playable in DOOM 1 as well.
